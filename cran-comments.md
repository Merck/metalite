## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have fixed the issues identified in v0.1.0:

* Updated DESCRIPTION to add more details to the Description field.
* Skipped adding references to the Description field for now, as after evaluation, no appropriate publications or links were identified.
* Removed the usage of `:::` in documentation.

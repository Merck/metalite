Description: A metadata structure for clinical data analysis
    and reporting based on Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets. 
    It offers a foundation to simplify tool development and 
    create standard engineering workflows. For example, 
    metalite can be used to: standardize input and output for 
    A&R functions, create analysis and reporting planning grid; 
    create mock table, create and validate A&R results, and 
    trace analysis records. It offers an unified data structure 
    for metadata information in clinical analysis & reporting (A&R), 
    leveraging the ADaM datasets for consistent and accurate 
    metadata representation.
